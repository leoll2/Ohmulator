# Ohmulator
A simple web-based circuit solver. Basically, you draw a circuit with your mouse and it solves it! 
It only supports basic linear components, but it still can be useful for small projects as it's more intuitive and handy than SPICE softwares.
It was entirely developed by me (Leonardo Lai) as project for a university exam (Web Design).
It mostly runs in the browser (almost everything is JS), except a few features (like storage) that require a server.
There are many things to improve, maybe if I have time I'll do something.
